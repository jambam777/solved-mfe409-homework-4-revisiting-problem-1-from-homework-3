<strong>Revisiting problem 1 from homework 3</strong>

We will consider additional variations on how to compute VaR for the return series and how to judge accuracy of VaR.

<ol>

 <li>Go back to the previous homework. For each day in the sample, computethe 95% confidence intervals of the historical VaR and the exponential weighted VaR you obtained in Question 1 of homework 3, using both parametric (for the historical VaR) and bootstrap methods (for the two measures). For the parametric method, assume the gains are normally distributed.</li>

 <li>Compute volatility using the EWMA with <em>λ </em>= 0<em>.</em> Compute the corresponding measure of VaR.</li>

 <li>Use maximum likelihood estimation to estimate a GARCH model forvolatility. Compute the corresponding measure of VaR.</li>

 <li>Revisit your answer to question 5 last week in light of these new results.</li>

</ol>

 <li><strong>Case Study: Implementing Quantitative Risk Management and VaR in a Chinese Investment Bank</strong></li>

 <li>Explain the objectives and priorities of each player: Jasper Wang, JianguoLu, and Charles Pan. What is motivating the different players? What tensions existed among their different objectives?</li>

 <li>Why does Jasper choose to make the VaR model the first step towardsrationalizing the trading function? What is the appeal of the VaR model generally?</li>

 <li>Why do Jianguo and the traders resist the VaR model? Do you think theirpattern of resistance to risk management is unique to China, or might it be found elsewhere too?</li>

 <li>Using the spreadsheet provided, run backtests of the VaR predictionsagainst actual daily gains or losses for both the S&amp;P 500 index and the Shanghai Composite index.

  <ul>

   <li>Starting with a lookback period of three months, observe the numberof exceptions in all years for both the Shanghai and S&amp;P indexes. How do they compare?</li>

   <li>Try different lookback periods (say, 3, 6 and 9 months) to see if thelength of the period changes your conclusions.</li>

   <li>Given that Jasper’s VaR model assumes a 95% confidence level, howwell does the backtest validate the model?</li>

  </ul></li>

 <li>How might Jasper use the backtest results to bolster his case for introducing the VaR model?</li>

 <li>How successful do you think Jasper will be in his attempt to implementWestern risk management practices? What advice would you give to someone in a role similar to his?</li>

 <li>What is the current regulation environment of risk followed by Chinesebanks and how has it evolved since the crisis? <em>(Find information beyond the case study material)</em></li>
